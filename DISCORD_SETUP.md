## When You Get a Valid Discord Invite:

### 1. Update the Main Website (index.html)
Replace the temporary Discord links with your actual invite:

**Line ~1633:** Replace `onclick="alert('Discord community coming soon! Stay tuned for updates.')"` with:
```html
href="YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE_LINK" target="_blank"
```

**Line ~1894:** Replace the Discord Coming Soon section with:
```html
<h3>Discord Community</h3>
<p>Join our community for real-time support, discussions, and updates about AetherOS development.</p>
<a href="YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE_LINK" class="btn-secondary" target="_blank" style="margin-top: 1rem; display: inline-block;">Join Discord</a>
```

**Footer Social Links (~1924):** Replace:
```html
<a href="#" onclick="alert('Discord community coming soon! Stay tuned for updates.')" title="Discord">ðŸ’¬</a>
```
with:
```html
<a href="YOUR_DISCORD_INVITE_LINK" target="_blank" title="Discord">ðŸ’¬</a>
```

### 2. Update Other Pages
- Update `docs.html` Discord references (lines ~633, ~639)
- Update any other Discord mentions throughout the site

### 3. Create Discord Server Setup
When setting up your Discord server, consider these channels:
- `#general` - General discussion
- `#aetheros-support` - Technical support
- `#development` - Development discussions
- `#gaming-optimization` - Gaming performance help
- `#ai-features` - AI agent discussions
- `#bug-reports` - Bug reports and issues
- `#feature-requests` - New feature suggestions

### 4. Discord Invite Settings
- Set invite to never expire (or set appropriate expiration)
- Set max uses to unlimited (or appropriate limit)
- Consider creating role-based access for different user types

## Current Temporary Behavior
- Discord links show "Discord community coming soon!" alert
- Users are informed the community space is being set up
- No broken links that would confuse visitors
